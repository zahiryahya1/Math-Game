# Math-Game
programmed a simple math game for my cousins who are in elementary school.

Overview: When running, it displays questions on a window and asks the user for the solution.
          It renders the solution the user gives in real time. If correct, it will move on to
          the next question. The more questions that are answered correct, the higher the level
          and tougher the questions.
          
In Depth Discription: when the program begins, it will create a list of question objects with solution.
                      the questions are read in from a text file. Each question is randomly selected 
                      and displayed.
